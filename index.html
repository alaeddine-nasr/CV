    <p style="padding-top: 1;">I've always been motivated about being an entrepreneur,
        So After my study years, I decided to start my own project and to learn directly and by experience how to manage
        a project: team management,
        supply chain management, project progress traceability,lead generation, client relationship management,
        marketing strategy elaboration, and sales.
        I tried to follow what I love the most even more than technical stuff and coding which is connecting with
        customers and being a good seller and a
        good deal closer.
        I opened a Content creation and marketing Agency and started working with national and international clients for
        more than a year before I had to close it.
        My experience taught me that I need more corporate experience in order to successfully manage a company in the
        Future If I had to redo the same experience again.
        Now I want to learn more from corporate work and to mix with colleagues in order to exchange knowledge and grow
        together, Now I really want to implement
        my experience in IT and entrepreneurship in a big and successful company and have a good career as i am married
        now and i have more responsibilities, So Why not my next experience is working with you ! Living the corporate
        life and working with a talented team of experts to grow my network and technical skills as well and give my all
        to the company
